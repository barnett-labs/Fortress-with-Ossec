This script will auto install and configure:

	1. PortSentry:	The Sentry tools provide host-level security services for the Unix platform. PortSentry, Logcheck/LogSentry, and 			HostSentry protect against portscans, automate log file auditing, and detect suspicious login activity on a 				continuous basis.
					
	2. LogCheck: 	Logcheck is a simple utility which is designed to allow a system administrator to view the logfiles which are 				produced upon hosts under their control. It does this by mailing summaries of the logfiles to them, after first 			filtering out "normal" entries. Normal entries are entries which match one of the many included regular 				expression files contain in the database.

	3. ClamAV:	ClamAVÂ® is an open source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats.
